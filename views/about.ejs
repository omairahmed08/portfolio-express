      <p>
        As a web developer and a student at Centennial College, I am passionate
        about creating innovative and user-friendly web experiences. I thrive on
        the challenges of coding, problem-solving, and staying up-to-date with
        the latest web technologies. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript, I enjoy bringing ideas to life and building interactive
        websites that engage and inspire users. As a student, I am constantly
        seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills, whether through
        coursework, personal projects, or collaborating with fellow developers.
        I am excited to continue learning and growing in the ever-evolving field
        of web development, and I am committed to delivering high-quality
        solutions that make a positive impact..
