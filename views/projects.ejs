        <h3>Todo list</h3>
        <p>
          The Todo List is a dynamic web application created using JavaScript
          and DOM manipulation. It enables users to effectively manage their
          tasks by providing essential features such as adding new tasks,
          deleting specific tasks, and clearing the entire task list. Users can
          input tasks using an input field and add them to the list with a
          simple click. The ability to delete tasks individually allows for easy
          removal of completed or unnecessary items. Additionally, a convenient
          "Clear List" button is available to remove all tasks at once,
          providing a quick reset. By leveraging JavaScript's DOM manipulation
          capabilities, this Todo List offers a seamless and user-friendly
          interface for efficient task management and organization.

          shortcuts. The application also displays the current scores for each
